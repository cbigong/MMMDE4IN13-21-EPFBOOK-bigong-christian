## Questions about Rick and Morty
the person with id= is Jerry smith who's morty father
## How i figured it out
In the documentation provided in the tp, it is mentioned that the GET command https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character. allows us to get the list of all the characters, so I did a GET of this api and went through the list of characters to find the one whose id corresponded to 5.
